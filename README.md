# **AirBnB_clone v1 :sunny: - File storage / Console - with :snake: Python**

We made this project in order to learn how to recreate the AirBnB website, from the back-end data management to the front-end user interface.

This repo contains the first part of the project which consists in :

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

# **Command interpreter**

[**console.py**](console.py) - is used as the "entry-point" of the command-interpreter, here's the list of available commands:
    - **EOF** - exits the console <br>
    - **quit** - quit the console <br>
    - **emptyline** - emptyline method is here overloaded, in order to do nothing when you press enter <br>
    - **create** - Creates a new instance based on user input <br>
    - **show** - Prints the string representation of an instance, format \<classname\> \<id\> <br>
    - **destroy** - Deletes an instance and save modifications on the JSON file <br>
    - **all** - Prints all string representation of all instances based on the class name or not <br>
    - **update** - Updates an instance, based on class name and id provided by user, by adding or updating attributes <br>
